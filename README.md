## SurvLatent ODE

Abstract : Effective learning from electronic health records (EHR) data for prediction of clinical outcomes is often challenging because of features recorded at irregular timesteps and loss to follow-up as well as competing events such as death or disease progression. To that end, we propose a generative time-to-event model, SurvLatent ODE, which adopts an Ordinary Differential Equation-based Recurrent Neural Networks (ODE-RNN) as an encoder to effectively parameterize a latent representation under irregularly sampled data. Our model then utilizes the latent representation to flexibly estimate survival times for multiple competing events without specifying shapes of event-specific hazard function. We demonstrate competitive performance of our model on MIMIC-III, a freely-available longitudinal dataset collected from critical care units, on predicting hospital mortality as well as the in-house data on predicting onset of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), a life-threatening complication for patients with cancer, with death as a competing event. SurvLatent ODE outperforms the current clinical standard Khorana Risk scores for stratifying DVT risk groups.

### Model architecture of SurvLatent ODE: 
The ODE-RNN encoder parametrizes a patient-specific temporal trajectory of covariates $x_i(0),...,x_i(p)$ into the latent embedding and describes approximate posterior over the initial latent variable $z_{i,0}$. The sampled initial latent variable $z_{i,0}$ is then decoded into the latent trajectory, $z_i^{t_m}  = (z_{i,1}, z_{i,2}, ..., z_{i,t_m})$ by calling a black-box differential equation solver ODESolve$(g_{\phi}, z_{i,0}, t = 0, ...,t_m)$. Finally, $m_\beta(\cdot)$, which consists of cause-specific decoder modules, subsequent fully connected layer, and softmax layer, maps the corresponding latent trajectory to estimate cause-specific hazard function for each event.

We'll release more examples with public datasets soon.
